i will write each and evey thing a in it

This is about how i create an ml project an how the modules and project structure looks like.

Initially i create a github repository as a generic one(which don't have anything in it)
then craete file in my localmechine c: user-> mlproject-> anacoda prompt-> cd to c:user/mlproject/ -> code . --> opened vs in that location directory --> vs terminal -> vscs (conda create -p venv(foldername) python== 3.8 (version) -y (verfication yes))--> conda activate venu/ (activate ever enviroment) -->  
now sync the git hub with project using github quick setup --> git init
git add README.md--> git commit -m "first commit" --> git branch M main
git remote and orgin user git repo link --> git push -u orgin main
