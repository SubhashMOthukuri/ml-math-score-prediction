Project Structure:
## ML End-to-End Project Setup

This document outlines how to create an ML project, including the project structure and module setup.

### **1. Creating a GitHub Repository**

- Start by creating an empty repository on GitHub.

### **2. Setting Up the Local Environment**

1. Create a project folder on your local machine:
   ```bash
   C:\Users\mlproject
   ```
2. Open Anaconda Prompt and navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd C:\Users\mlproject
   ```
3. Open VS Code in this directory:
   ```bash
   code .
   ```

### **3. Creating a Virtual Environment**

1. Create a virtual environment using Conda:
   ```bash
   conda create -p venv python=3.8 -y
   ```
2. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   conda activate venv/
   ```

### **4. Syncing with GitHub**

1. Initialize Git:
   ```bash
   git init
   ```
2. Add a README file and make the first commit:
   ```bash
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "First commit"
   ```
3. Set up the remote repository:
   ```bash
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin <your-github-repo-link>
   git push -u origin main
   ```
4. Create a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files from version control.
5. Pull the latest changes from GitHub:
   ```bash
   git pull
   ```

### **5. Automating Project Setup**

You can automate this process using setup commands.

### **6. Understanding `setup.py`**

- `setup.py` is used for packaging and distributing Python projects.
- This allows you to package your ML project and even deploy it to PyPI.
- `find_packages()` helps find all relevant packages related to the project.

### **7. Understanding `requirements.txt`**

- Lists all dependencies needed to run the project.
- Install dependencies using:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### **8. Understanding `-e .`**

- Enables **editable mode**, allowing code changes to reflect without reinstalling the package.

### **9. Deploying to PyPI**

- After setup, `mltest.egg-info` is created, which can be deployed to PyPI.

## **Project Structure (Automated in 12 Lines of Code)**

### **1. Components**

- **`components/`**: Modules used for this specific project.
- **`__init__.py`**: Initializes the components package.
- **Data Ingestion**: Reads data from a database and splits it into train, test, and validation sets.
- **Data Transformation**: Converts text/categorical features to numerical features (e.g., One-Hot Encoding, Label Encoding).
- **Model Trainer**: Trains models, evaluates using metrics like confusion matrix & adjusted RÂ², and pushes models to the cloud.

### **2. Pipelines**

- **`__init__.py`**: Initializes the pipeline package.
- **Training Pipeline**: Calls the **Components** classes to train the model.
- **Prediction Pipeline**: Uses the trained model to make predictions.

### **3. Source Code Folder (`src/`)**

- **`logger.py`**: Handles logging throughout the project.
- **`exception.py`**: Manages exception handling.
- **`utils.py`**: Reads datasets, saves models, and interacts with cloud storage.
